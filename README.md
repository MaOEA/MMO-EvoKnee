# MMO-EvoKnee
Knee based Multimodal Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm for Decision Making

We propose a knee based evolutionary algorithm, named MMO-EvoKnee, which incorporates MCDM strategy into solving MMOPs. The proposed algorithm can find a complete set of global knee solutions accurately instead of an entire Pareto front and Pareto sets. As a result, MMO-EvoKnee can consistently find all knee solutions of interest quickly, and it relieves the burden for decision makers.
